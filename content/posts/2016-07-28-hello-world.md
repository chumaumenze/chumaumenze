If you’re a fan of programming, you’d be familiar with the above syntax. 
The “Hello World!” program is usually the first program one write while learning a programming language. 
In python, it is usually the first step. It was my first.

Hi! I’m Chuma Umenze, a code lover, Android geek, PC and Linux enthusiast. 
Currently, I am working on completing my Front-end certification on [Free Code Camp][FCC] 
and as well as completing my Python tutorial at [Solo Learn][Sololearn]

This is the beginning of a long journey. Graduated from the University with a degree in 
Political Science and with burning urge and passion for programming and software development. 
I’ve decided to use this medium to share with the world my journey in to the programming world. 
I am a novice to programming but the word itself sparks fire in me. I know it’s a long journey 
but I have to start somewhere, right?
