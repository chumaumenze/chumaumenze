So you’re may have finished your training as a developer or about to begin, what then? 
It’s setting up your development environment. This process has mostly been overlook and 
often leads to frustration while coding.

Whether you’re using Windows, Mac or Linux, setting up your environment is simple. For beginners, you will surely  need a text editor.

#### Text Editors

Text Editors are are programs designed to read and write codes. There are a lot of text 
editor good for writing program codes and languages. Some of the editors listed below 
includes an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

+ [Atom Text Editor](https://atom.io/)
+ [Sublime Text Editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/) 
+ [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
+ [Brackets](https://brackets.io/)
+ [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)
+ [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/)


#### Shell

The shell is particularly very useful for developers working with languages like 
Python, Perl, Ruby and others. On Windows, the default shell is called Command Prompt 
while on Mac and Linux, they are called Terminal. I highly recommend that beginners 
with Windows computers use a program called Cygwin instead of Command Prompt. 
This is because [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) lets you use a shell environment called “bash”–which is 
the same environment in Mac Terminal and most Linux systems. In addition, 
most shell commands you encounter on the web will probably be for the bash environment, 
so it’s best that you set up your development environment accordingly. If possible, 
dual boot your PC to have Windows and Linux say, Ubuntu or any other Debian distro 
(Don’t know how to dual boot your PC? click here). Why Linux? Because some development 
tools are only clicks away or preinstalled. For web developers, you surely need a supported 
web browsers, not IE (unless you want to frustate yourself) but Chrome, Firefox or Safari.

In conclusion, if you find setting up your environment frustrating, you can go download an IDE, 
if you don’t know where to find any, I’m sure some [Google-fu](http://google.com/search?q=IDE) will help.
